plottet are:
- per graph instance:
  - `duration` (comparing accross variants like kaspan and ispan) the duration over number of cores utilized
  - `speedup` (comparing accross variants like kaspan and ispan) the speedup over number of cores utilized where 1.0 is the fastest instance at the lowest number of cores that solved the problem
  - `memory` (comparing accross variants like kaspan and ispan) the memory allocation per core utilized
  - per variant (these two plots should be saved side by side in the same figure! ensure that there is a single legend with no duplicates!):
    - `step_throughput` (comparison of the throughput per algorithmic substep used in scc algorithm) as nodes per time over number of cores utilized
    - `step_duration` (comparison of the duration per algorithmic substep used in scc algorithm) as nodes per time over number of cores utilized - including a line that tells other (non step time consumed in scc algorithm)

based on weak or strong scaling the plotting might vary a bit, but general idea should be clear!

some constraints:
- `duration`:
  - y scale/steps as log 2
  - x scale/steps as log 10
  - y axis numbering as full integers without scientific notation
  - x axis numbering as scientific notation 10^i
  - min/max y as min/max y accross **ALL** data!
  - min x is 1 nano second!
  - max x is 1.1 * max x of data for this graph instance!
- `speedup`:
  - y scale/steps as log 2
  - x scale/steps as linear
  - y axis numbering as full integers without scientific notation
  - x axis numbering as full integers without scientific notation

  - max x is 1.1 * max x of data for this graph instance!
- `step_duration`:
  - y scale/steps as log 2
  - x scale/steps as log 10

All axis numbering as full numbers per step!

ensure accross all global plots that the line style is consistent for specific steps and variants!
ideal lines should not influence the x-axis limits!
